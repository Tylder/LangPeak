# Langpeak Ideas

## Onboarding new students
1. Consultation where their strengths, motivations, needs and goals are discussed and saved.

2. A realistic learning path is then created in collaboration with the student on how to reach those goals. 
(This should help create a long term view for the student of progress, so that they are less likely 
quit once it gets boring)  <br/>   The plan and what it should contain is discussed separately in this document.

3. Explain that we will try to customize the lessons to their interests and needs to keep them motivated.
We will therefore need them to answer questions regarding interests and hobbies, and special subject that we could
focus on more.


## Onboarding new Teachers
1. Given material to read how to best teach. Casual interview where they can explain what their thoughts and feelings
are regarding the information they received.

2. Explaination of the payment scheme. (Dependant on lessons per week, total lessons done, student and owner score)
Purpose is to make it clear that effort and skill matters and will be rewarded.

3. 


## Lesson Plan
1. Designed to make the student feel that its been customized for them and that they would be hard pressed to get something 
equal or better elsewhere. 

2. They should clearly see what is expected and what they would have to do to reach their set goals. And what we 
provide to help them reach that goal.

3. Perfect opportunity to up sell more courses and perhaps other specialty items such as profession specific lessons,  
since they are hopeful and hopefully impressed by the plan.

4. We need to calculate an estimated time or lesson count to reach their goal, offer all lessons as a package.

5. Make it clear that learning any language requires the active participation of both parties, teacher and student. 
In order to reach the goal they will need to set aside the time and focus for a set time. Depending on their goals
we could also provide specific homework as well. For an extra cost.

6. The lesson plan should be presented in a professional way. Both in PDF format for potential print and available on their 
user page to review.


## Lesson
- Each lesson to be based around a general subject that it intends to teach. Probably taken from a book.
- Each lesson can then be made with different themes, such as travel, food, tech..
- Each lesson should also be made into several levels.
